   If no BlockVision API key is provided, the system will automatically fall back to the default Sui mainnet RPC endpoint.

## Getting Your Private Key

### From Sui Wallet Browser Extension:
1. Open Sui Wallet
2. Go to Settings ‚Üí Export Private Key
3. Copy the private key (starts with `suiprivkey1`)

### From Sui CLI:
```bash
sui client active-address
sui keytool export --key-identity [your-address] --json
```

## Getting Your BlockVision API Key (Optional)

BlockVision provides enhanced RPC endpoints with better performance and reliability:

1. **Sign up at BlockVision:**
   - Visit [BlockVision.org](https://blockvision.org)
   - Create an account
   - Navigate to the API section

2. **Get your API key:**
   - Generate a new API key for Sui Mainnet
   - Copy the API key

3. **Add to your `.env` file:**
   ```
   BLOCKVISION_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   USE_HTTPS=true
   ```

**Note:** If you don't have a BlockVision API key, the system will automatically use the default Sui mainnet RPC endpoint.

```

## Project Workflow

### 1. Create a Project
```bash
npm run create
```
- Enter token name, symbol, description
- Add icon URL and social links
- Set tags and transaction limits
- Project is saved with status "created"

### 2. Launch Token
```bash
npm run launch
```
The system automatically detects distribution status and shows appropriate launch options:

#### üéØ Normal Launch (Always Available)
- Select a project to launch
- Set SUI amount for first buy (default: 0.1 SUI)
- Set minimum tokens to receive
- Confirm launch parameters

**Process:**
1. **Deploy Token Contract** - Creates the Move smart contract
2. **Create Bonding Curve** - Sets up the automated market maker
3. **Perform First Buy** - Bootstraps the curve with initial liquidity

#### üéØ Launch & Bundle (Available with Funded Distribution)
When a distribution exists and wallets are funded, you'll see both options:
- **Launch Token (Normal)** - Standard launch process
- **Launch & Bundle** - Launch + immediate bundled purchases

**Bundle Process:**
1. **Normal Launch** - Completes standard deployment and dev buy
2. **Bundled Purchases** - Executes purchases from distribution wallets
3. **Progress Tracking** - Shows real-time success/failure rates
4. **Batch Processing** - Handles multiple wallets efficiently

**Auto-Detection:**
- No distribution: Shows "Normal Launch" only
- Distribution exists but unfunded: Shows "Normal Launch" only + funding reminder
- Distribution funded: Shows both "Normal Launch" and "Launch & Bundle" options

### 3. Buy Tokens from Existing Bonding Curves
```bash
npm run buy
```
Purchase tokens from any existing bonding curve on the Sui blockchain:

**Input Options:**
1. **üéØ Bonding curve address** (direct - fastest): Enter the bonding curve address directly
2. **üì¶ Token contract address** (via Kappa API): Enter full token type (e.g., `0x123...::module::TOKEN`)

### 5. Create Token Distribution (PRE-LAUNCH)
```bash
npm run distribute
```
The Distribution Manager creates bundled token purchases for PRE-LAUNCH tokens with varied distribution patterns:

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important: This is for PRE-LAUNCH tokens (status: created)**

**Features:**
- **Bundle Options**: 25%, 50%, 75%, 99% of 700M bonding curve tokens, or custom amount
- **Wallet Generation**: Automatically generates wallets with private keys
- **AMM-like Distribution**: Uses exponential decay with randomness for realistic distribution
- **SUI Funding Calculation**: Calculates exact SUI needed for each wallet (including gas)
- **File Organization**: Creates JSON and CSV files in organized directories

**Process:**
1. Select a created (PRE-LAUNCH) token project
2. Choose bundle percentage (% of 700M tokens)
3. Set wallet percentage range (min/max % per wallet)
4. Review distribution preview
5. Generate wallets and distribution files

**Output Files:**
- `distributions/{token_name}/distribution.json` - Complete distribution data
- `distributions/{token_name}/distribution.csv` - Spreadsheet format
- Includes wallet addresses, private keys, token amounts, and funding requirements

**Distribution Algorithm:**
- First wallet gets maximum allocation
- Subsequent wallets use exponential decay (0.8 factor)
- Random variation (¬±20%) for natural distribution
- Respects min/max percentage constraints
- Optimizes for realistic trading patterns

### 6. Fund Distribution Wallets
```bash
npm run fund
```
Funds all wallets in a distribution with their calculated SUI amounts:

**Process:**
1. Select a distribution to fund
2. Review funding requirements
3. Confirm funding operation
4. Master wallet funds each distribution wallet
5. Updates distribution files with funding status

**What it does:**
- Calculates precise SUI amounts using bonding curve mathematics
- Transfers exact SUI amounts to each wallet (tokens + gas + slippage buffer)
- Tracks funding status and transaction hashes
- Updates distribution JSON with funding metadata
- Provides detailed progress reporting

**SUI Calculation System:**
- Uses proper AMM (Automated Market Maker) formula for accurate pricing
- Accounts for 1% trading fees and 10% slippage buffer
- Separate calculations for PRE-LAUNCH vs POST-LAUNCH tokens
- Reverse bonding curve math: calculates SUI needed for desired tokens
- Replaces old fixed-price system (0.0001 SUI per token) with dynamic pricing

### 7. Return SUI to Master
```bash
npm run return-sui
```
Returns remaining SUI from distribution wallets back to master wallet:

**Process:**
1. Select a distribution to return SUI from
2. Checks each wallet's balance
3. Returns all SUI except minimal gas reserve
4. Transfers back to master wallet

**What it does:**
- Scans all distribution wallets for remaining SUI
- Leaves 0.001 SUI in each wallet for gas
- Returns everything else to master wallet
- Provides detailed return reporting

### 6. Complete PRE-LAUNCH Workflow
```
1. Create Project (npm run create)
2. Create Distribution (npm run distribute) 
3. Fund Wallets (npm run fund)
4. Launch Token (npm run launch)
5. Execute Bundled Purchases (manual/automated)
6. Return SUI (npm run return-sui)
```

### 4. Monitor Projects
```bash
npm run list
```
- View all projects grouped by status
- See deployment details and transaction history
- Delete projects if needed
